<p>Under the consultance and guidance of senior professors in the department, here are some larger projects I am part of.</p>
<p><em><strong>Online Psychometrics Center</strong></em> (since August 2019)</p>
<p>With an aim to bring psychological assessment to anyone and everyone, this online platform provides free assessment and personalized reports to respondents and participants.</p>
<p>In phase 1, career testing and assessment was done for 15,000 students of India (mostly, Maharashtra). While MUPI was developed as part of this project, I designed and automated psychometric reports using R sweave. Tools were developed keeping the Indian diversity in mind and in various Indian languages including Hindi, Marathi, Konkani, Kannada, Malayalam, Assamese and English.</p>
<p><em><strong>Brain-Behaviour Laboratory at Mumbai University</strong></em> (since November 2019)</p>
<p>Department for Applied Psychology at Mumbai University will soon house a Brain-Behaviour Laboratory with eye-tracking and EEG equipment. I am associated with the same in capacity of an Associate Researcher along with 2 other professors.</p>
<p>I intend to hold experiments in the field of political neuroscience understanding processes in ideological differences, group biases and perception of favourable and unfavourable leaders, and neuropsychological underpinnings of political choices and preferences.</p>
<p><em><strong>Collaboration with the Habitats Trust, Noida</strong></em> (upcoming)</p>
<p>The Habitats Trust works to conserve natural habitats and sustainable ecosystems for the future generations.</p>
<p>In an upcoming project, they intend to work with a team of psychologists to understand people-environment interaction and how conservation can be encouraged across India. Psychological profiling across landscapes will help to understand attitudes towards environment, place attachment, morality and other variables that can serve as predictors, determinants and moderators of conservation.</p>
